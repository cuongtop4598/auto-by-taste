## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- EN | VI toggle buttons in navbar (user preference for inline buttons over dropdown)
- localStorage for persistence (simpler than cookies, no backend needed)
- Translate content myself (user doesn't have translations ready)
- [Phase 01-i18n-foundation]: Nested translation structure organized by component with 2-3 level nesting max
- [Phase 01-i18n-foundation]: Type enforcement via Translation type export ensures EN/VI structure match
- [Phase 01-i18n-foundation]: Vitest with jsdom for test environment (React Testing Library compatible)
- [Phase 01]: Memoized context value with useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [Phase 01]: Separated concerns: 3 test files (context, persistence, lang-attribute) for clarity
- [Phase 02]: Placed ChipComparison between #org-chart and #models for logical hardware flow
