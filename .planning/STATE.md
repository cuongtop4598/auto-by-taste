- **Next:** Phase 03 Plan 01 - Interactive Mac selector

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use tsParticles over particles.js | particles.js abandoned; tsParticles actively maintained | 2026-03-05 |
| Canvas 2D over WebGL | Sufficient for <300 particles; smaller bundle | 2026-03-05 |
| Lazy load particle library | Don't block LCP; particles are decorative | 2026-03-05 |
| Adaptive particle counts | Mobile performance constraints | 2026-03-05 |
| Mac → AI models (not reverse) | User preference; simpler v1 scope | 2026-03-05 |
| Use @tsparticles/slim over full bundle | Reduce bundle size from 300KB to 80KB while keeping neural network connections | 2026-03-05 |
| Implement TDD for particle config | Ensure device detection works correctly across all device types | 2026-03-05 |
| Set up Vitest as test framework | Standard testing framework for Vite projects with zero-config integration | 2026-03-05 |
| Use CSS variables for z-index hierarchy | Prevents future z-index conflicts by establishing clear hierarchy | 2026-03-05 |
| Create glass-card-strong variant | Sections needing more prominence while maintaining particle visibility | 2026-03-05 |
| Safari compatibility priority | Added -webkit-backdrop-filter prefix and @supports fallback for cross-browser support | 2026-03-05 |
| Navbar z-index adjustment | Changed from z-50 to z-20 to match CSS variable hierarchy | 2026-03-05 |
| TypeScript interfaces over classes | Static data has no behavior; interfaces are simpler and enable better tree-shaking | 2026-03-05 |
| TDD with RED-GREEN commits | Provides clear audit trail of test-driven development; tests prove correctness | 2026-03-05 |
| Q4_K_M quantization baseline | 75% size reduction with minimal quality loss; standard for local AI deployment | 2026-03-05 |
| Document M3 Pro bandwidth regression | M3 Pro has 150 GB/s vs M2 Pro 200 GB/s - known Apple design change | 2026-03-05 |
| 16GB base for M4 Macs | Mac Mini M4 and newer start at 16GB as of Oct 2024 Apple update | 2026-03-05 |
| Combine Tasks 1 and 2 for efficient implementation | Chip selection and details panel are integral to component design | 2026-03-05 |
| Use Pro variants for generation comparison clarity | Pro models represent best balance across generations | 2026-03-05 |
| Add performance uplift percentages for user education | Helps users understand generational improvements at a glance | 2026-03-05 |

## Dependencies to Install

```bash
# Phase 1 dependencies
npm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/slim

# Optional for UI animations
npm install framer-motion
```

- ProblemSolution.tsx (glass morphism)

## Context for Next Session

To resume work:
1. Run `/gsd:progress` to see current state
2. Start Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
3. Or execute directly with `/gsd:execute-phase 1`

Key context:
- Existing codebase has 13 components in /components/
- Using React 19.2.4 + Vite 6.2.0 + Tailwind CDN
- Recharts already installed for data viz
- Vietnamese language content
- Zalo for contact integration
- No backend - static site only
