## Session History

### 2026-03-05: Project Initialization & Phase 01 Execution
- Mapped existing codebase (13 components, React 19, Vite, Tailwind)
- Created PROJECT.md with requirements
- Completed domain research (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
- Synthesized research into SUMMARY.md
- Created REQUIREMENTS.md with 7 requirements
- Created ROADMAP.md with 6 phases
- **Executed:** Phase 01 Plan 01 - Particle background system (5 tasks, 6 commits, 288s)
- **Executed:** Phase 01 Plan 02 - Glassmorphism UI enhancement (5 tasks, 4 commits, 180m)
- **Status:** Phase 01 Complete
- **Next:** Phase 02 - Mac Hardware Data

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Use tsParticles over particles.js | particles.js abandoned; tsParticles actively maintained | 2026-03-05 |
| Canvas 2D over WebGL | Sufficient for <300 particles; smaller bundle | 2026-03-05 |
| Lazy load particle library | Don't block LCP; particles are decorative | 2026-03-05 |
| Adaptive particle counts | Mobile performance constraints | 2026-03-05 |
| Mac → AI models (not reverse) | User preference; simpler v1 scope | 2026-03-05 |
| Use @tsparticles/slim over full bundle | Reduce bundle size from 300KB to 80KB while keeping neural network connections | 2026-03-05 |
| Implement TDD for particle config | Ensure device detection works correctly across all device types | 2026-03-05 |
| Set up Vitest as test framework | Standard testing framework for Vite projects with zero-config integration | 2026-03-05 |
| Use CSS variables for z-index hierarchy | Prevents future z-index conflicts by establishing clear hierarchy | 2026-03-05 |
| Create glass-card-strong variant | Sections needing more prominence while maintaining particle visibility | 2026-03-05 |
| Safari compatibility priority | Added -webkit-backdrop-filter prefix and @supports fallback for cross-browser support | 2026-03-05 |
| Navbar z-index adjustment | Changed from z-50 to z-20 to match CSS variable hierarchy | 2026-03-05 |

## Blockers

None currently.

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files | Commits | Date |

## Dependencies to Install

```bash
# Phase 1 dependencies
npm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/slim

# Optional for UI animations
npm install framer-motion
```

## Files Changed

### Planning (this session)
- .planning/PROJECT.md - Created
- .planning/config.json - Created
- .planning/codebase/*.md - Created (7 files)
- .planning/research/*.md - Created (5 files)
- .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md - Created
- .planning/ROADMAP.md - Created
- .planning/STATE.md - Created

### Code (Phase 01-01 completed)
Completed:
- package.json (tsParticles dependencies)
- package-lock.json (dependency lockfile)
- components/particles/ParticleBackground.tsx (main component)
- components/particles/particleConfig.ts (device-adaptive config)
- components/particles/particleConfig.test.ts (12 passing tests)
- components/particles/useParticleEngine.ts (lifecycle hook)
- vitest.config.ts (test framework config)
- App.tsx (integrated ParticleBackground)

Phase 01-02 completed:
- index.html (z-index CSS variables, glass-card utilities)
- Navbar.tsx, Footer.tsx (glass morphism)
- ProblemSolution.tsx (glass morphism)

## Context for Next Session

To resume work:
1. Run `/gsd:progress` to see current state
2. Start Phase 1 with `/gsd:plan-phase 1`
3. Or execute directly with `/gsd:execute-phase 1`

Key context:
- Existing codebase has 13 components in /components/
- Using React 19.2.4 + Vite 6.2.0 + Tailwind CDN
- Recharts already installed for data viz
- Vietnamese language content
- Zalo for contact integration
- No backend - static site only
