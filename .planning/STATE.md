## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Abandon v1.0 i18n -- pivot to Hero redesign
- SVG chip diagram (not 3D) for bundle size
- M4 family (M4/Pro/Max) maps to product tiers
- Zero new dependencies -- CSS keyframes + custom hooks only
- Compositor-only animation properties (opacity, transform) for performance
- prefers-reduced-motion built in from Phase 3, not retrofitted
- Used 0.01ms duration (not 0) in reduced-motion to avoid breaking CSS animation events
- Compositor-only properties enforced: opacity, transform, stroke-dashoffset
- tops field kept optional on Chip interface -- only M4 has marketed TOPS values
- useCountUp accepts trigger param for composability with useInView
